## ✨ Key Features

### 👁️ Visual Previews
- **Node Integration**: Direct image previews on Prompt Gallery node
- **Quick Edit Previews**: Preview support in editing interfaces
- **Selection Previews**: Visual feedback during file selection
- **Custom Previews**: Easy custom preview image assignment

### 🖼️ Prompt Extractor
- **Drop an Image, Get Tags**: Drop any previously generated image on the node and its positive prompt comes back as editable tag pills
- **Reads Everything**: ComfyUI's embedded graph, the editor workflow, and A1111/Forge parameters in PNG text chunks or JPEG/WebP EXIF
- **Positive Only**: Traces the graph backwards from the sampler's `positive` input — negatives and unconnected leftover nodes are never picked up
- **Recovers Toggled-Off Tags**: If the image came from an EreNodes workflow, tags that were switched *off* come back as inactive pills, with their strengths and types intact
- **Just Tags After That**: Fully editable — toggle, add, reorder, drag into another node, or save as a tag group

### 🧱 Prompt Composer
- **Categories, Not Nodes**: Keep character, outfit, background and quality apart in one node instead of four chained ones — each category has its own tag area, ≡ and + buttons
- **Fold What You Are Not Editing**: Click a category header to collapse it; the layout is saved with the workflow
- **Bypass a Whole Category**: The switch on the right turns one off without touching a single tag inside it, so switching it back on restores exactly what was there
- **Drag Categories**: Reorder them by their header, or drag one straight into another Prompt Composer
- **Same Pills Everywhere**: Tags drag between categories, and in and out of every other prompt node, exactly as they always have

### 📁 Tag Groups Management
- **Favorite Prompts**: Save and organize your most-used prompts with tags, LoRAs, and trigger words
- **Direct Node Integration**: Create tag groups directly from nodes with subfolder organization
- **Quick Application**: Easy loading of saved tag groups as convenient pills or their content
- **Import/Export**: Seamless sharing and backup of your tag collections
- **Choose Where They Live**: Keep tag groups in the node folder or in `ComfyUI/models/tag_groups` so they survive reinstalls and Manager updates
- **Bulk Import Script**: `scripts/animadex_to_tag_groups.py` builds tag groups (with covers) from the animadex.net character catalogue — a standalone command-line tool for anyone who wants a large character library in one go; see `scripts/README.md`

### 🗂️ EreNodes Sidebar
- **Native Sidebar Tab**: Browse tag groups, LoRAs and embeddings in a proper ComfyUI sidebar tab
- **Two-Mode Search**: Filter by file and folder name or the tags *inside* every group
- **Autocomplete in Tag Search**: the search box completes tags as you type, offering only tags your groups actually contain (with counts)
- **Hover Previews**: Hover any entry to see its thumbnail and its tags, drawn with the exact same pills the nodes use
- **Drag Both Ways**: Drag an entry onto an existing node to add it — or drag a node's tag pills onto a sidebar folder to open the editor and save them as a new tag group
- **Group or Contents, Your Choice**: A dragged tag group lands as one pill by default; hold **Alt** to drop its tags instead. The ghost tells you which
- **Drop an Image to Build a Group**: Drop a generated image anywhere on the tree to create a group from its prompt, with the image kept as the cover
- **Pick Tags Out of a Preview**: Hover a tag group, move into the preview, select tags you want and drag just those into a prompt node

### ✏️ Advanced Tag Editing
- **Missing File Warnings**: LoRA, embedding and tag group pills turn red-bordered when the file they name isn't on disk
- **Effortless Replacement**: Quick edit tags or replacement of LoRAs, embeddings and Tag Groups
- **Strength Control**: Precise tag strength adjustment via buttons or intuitive click-dragging
- **Rich Previews**: Set and view preview images for all content types
- **Dynamic Triggers**: Toggle LoRA trigger words with familiar tag pill interface

### 🖐️ Drag & Drop Tag Pills
- **Reorder by Dragging**: Hold a pill for a moment (or just start moving it) to enter reorder mode — a live placeholder shows exactly where it will land
- **Move Between Nodes**: Drag pills from one prompt node into another; hold **Alt** while dropping to copy instead of move
- **Multi-Select**: **Ctrl+click** picks individual pills (they don't need to be next to each other), **Ctrl+drag** sweep a selected pill again to drop it, just like Explorer — and **Shift+click** selects a range
- **Bulk Actions**: Right-click any pill in a selection for Enable / Disable / Toggle / Remove, or save and export just those tags as a group
- **Works Everywhere**: Cloud, Toggle, MultiSelect, Randomizer and Gallery nodes all share the same behaviour

### 🔍 Smart Autocomplete
- **Comprehensive Dictionaries**: Built-in tag lists from Danbooru and e621, plus support for custom CSV files in the `__autocomplete__` folder or the update-safe user folder
- **Intelligent Aliases**: Automatic tag alias detection and replacement with canonical terms
- **Flexible Search**: Partial matching support, including multi-word tag recognition
- **Visual Highlighting**: Clear highlighting of filtered terms for enhanced clarity

## 🧭 Compatibility

- **ComfyUI**: registered via standard `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS` (works on current and older installs). Node IDs are stable — workflows remain interchangeable.
- **Subgraphs**: supported. The prefix separator is passed as a real input instead of being read from workflow metadata.
- **Nodes 2.0 (Vue renderer)**: supported. Tag UI is DOM widgets in both the classic LiteGraph renderer and Nodes 2.0 (same implementation). The old canvas-drawn UI was removed; it remains available in git history.

## 📦 Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

**Via ComfyUI Manager:**
1. Open ComfyUI Manager in your ComfyUI interface
2. Search for "EreNodes" 
3. Click Install
4. Restart ComfyUI

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Navigate to your ComfyUI custom_nodes directory
cd /path/to/ComfyUI/custom_nodes

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/erehr/ComfyUI-EreNodes.git

# Restart ComfyUI
```

> **Tip**: After installation, you'll find the new nodes under the "EreNodes" category in your ComfyUI node browser.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Setup

1. **Custom Autocomplete**: Place bundled CSV files in the `__autocomplete__` folder within the EreNodes directory. For custom CSVs, place them in `ComfyUI/user/__erenodes/autocomplete` and choose the file in Settings; this folder is created automatically.
2. **Preview Images**: Add preview images to enhance your tag browsing experience
3. **Create Your First Tag Group**: Use any EreNodes prompt node to save your favorite tag combinations

### 🎮 Basic Usage

**Using Autocomplete:**
- Start typing in any EreNodes text or add tag field
- Use Tab or arrow keys to navigate suggestions
- Press Enter to select
- Enjoy intelligent tag completion with aliases

**Managing Tag Groups:**
- Click on any tag nodes ≡ menu button to "Save as Tag Group". Select (or create) folder, type filename and select optional image. 
- Access saved groups through the ≡ 'Load Tag Group' (loading content of tag group) or + button 'Add tag' (loading tag group as single combined pill)
- Import/export tag groups for sharing with the community

**LoRA Loading:**

EreNodes provides flexible LoRA loading options to fit different workflow preferences:

| Method | Description | Compatible Nodes | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| **LoRA Stack** | Use "Prompt to LoRA Stack" node to extract `<lora:name:strength>` tags and connect to stack-compatible nodes | • [Efficiency Nodes](https://github.com/jags111/efficiency-nodes-comfyui)<br>• [ComfyRoll Custom Nodes](https://github.com/Suzie1/ComfyUI_Comfyroll_CustomNodes)<br>• [LoRA Manager](https://github.com/willmiao/ComfyUI-Lora-Manager) | Best for mixing multiple sources of LoRAs |
| **Direct Loading** | Use nodes that load LoRAs directly from prompt text in place of standard LoRA loaders. | • [LoRA Tag Loader](https://github.com/badjeff/comfyui_lora_tag_loader)<br>• [Impact Wildcard Encode](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack)<br>• [PCLazyLoRALoader](https://github.com/asagi4/comfyui-prompt-control) | Best for simple workflows or when using wildcards |

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Search Efficiently**: Use partial matches or space for multi word phrases
- **Visual Organization**: Set preview images for your most-used ta groups
- **Quick Edits**: Right-click any tag for instant editing options
- **Rearrange Fast**: Drag pills to reorder them, or straight into another prompt node — Ctrl+click first to move several at once
- **Experiment**: Use the Randomizer node to discover new prompt combinations
- **Convertible**: All tag nodes can be converted to another under ≡ menu
- **Customize output**: Separators between nodes and individual tags are edited in ≡ → Options, or in node Properties

## 📋 Changelog

### Version 3.6 - Latest
- **Per-category layouts in the Composer**: each category draws as Cloud, Toggle, MultiSelect, Gallery or Multiline, from its ≡ menu —> Layout
- **Drop tags into a prompt textarea**: pills and tag groups can be dragged into the Prompt Multiline node and Composer multiline category
- **New `text` tag type**: a pill holding a whole sentences, so tags and natural language prompts can mix in one node
- **Separators on the node**: tag and node separators are now editable from node ≡ → Options

### Version 3.5
- **New Node: Prompt Composer**: several tag clouds in one node as reorderable, collapsible categories

### Version 3.4
- **Sidebar Tag search**: now as alternative mode, automatically indexing cache database in background
- **Autocomplete on the sidebar search box** (tag mode only): only from actual tags in tag groups (cached)
- **Prompt randomizer** added missing seed control

### Version 3.3
- **Tag group editor** in sidebar.
- **Drop an image on the sidebar**: extracts its prompt *and* keeps the image as the group's cover
- **Prompt Extractor node** - image drop area prompt extraction
- **Missing file warnings** - red border on lora / embedding / tag group pills whose file isn't on disk

### Version 3.2
- **EreNodes sidebar**: native sidebar for managing tag groups / LoRAs / embeddings
- **Search inside tag groups**: sidebar filter matching file names *and* the tags a group contains
- **Configurable tag group folder**: node folder (default, unchanged) or in `ComfyUI/models/tag_groups`
- **Type-coloured drag feedback**: ghost and target highlight during tag drag

### Version 3.1
- **Drag & drop reorder**: press-and-hold (or move) a tag pill to reorder it, with a live drop placeholder and drag preview
- **Drag between nodes**: move pills across any pill-based prompt nodes; **Alt** while dropping copies instead of moving, duplicate names are skipped
- **Multi-select**: **Ctrl+click** toggles individual pills, **Ctrl+drag** rubber-bands a box over them (Explorer-style — re-sweeping a selected pill deselects it), **Shift+click** selects a range, **Esc** or a click outside clears it — a drag started on a selected pill carries the whole set
- **Selection actions**: right-clicking a selected pill opens bulk Enable / Disable / Toggle / Remove, plus "Save Selected as Tag Group" and "Export Selected"
- **Quick edit cleanup**: Move Up / Move Down were dropped from the right-click menu now that pills can simply be dragged

### Version 3.0
- **Nodes 2.0 ready**: tag UI rendered as DOM widgets in both classic and Vue renderers
- **Subgraph support**: prefix separator is a real (hidden) input; property panel remains the edit surface
- **Gallery performance**: previews are plain `<img>` elements (browser cache, lazy loading) — no manual bitmap cache needed
- **Randomizer**: "control after generate" now triggers once per completed prompt (works correctly with queued batches)
- **Many bug fixes**: global autocomplete attachment, overwrite-confirm dialog, settings sync, stale text on workflow load, safer file-serving routes, gallery previews for filenames with special characters, button tooltips

### Version 2.1
- **New Node: Prompt Gallery**: Powerful and intuitive grid-based gallery for browsing and selecting tags
- **Tag Group Image on Save**: You can now set a preview image when saving a Tag Group
